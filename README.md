## Reflection

This application is a product of a web development course where the aim was to help beginners to have a better understanding of web development while teaching Javascript and also intermediate developers to familiarize themselves with this tech stack. The course has helped me become the developer I am today and is what inspired me to pursue a Javascript tech stack in the web development space. I would later learn of React and other popular frameworks which have made this process a lot more enjoyable.

One of the main challenges I faced while working on this project was the back-end. I was initially more comfortable with front-end design and implementation and therefore took a while to wrap my head around the process of setting up a No-SQL database, setting cookies in the browser, encrypting user passwords, and setting up JSON Web Tokens. The time I took to further understand how the back-end works served me well and resulted in my success of building this project.
